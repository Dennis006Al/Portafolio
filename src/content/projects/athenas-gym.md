details:
  overview: 'This internal application was developed to manage gym membership contracts, including pricing plans, promotions, and access to gym facilities. It serves as a tool for the internal staff to efficiently handle client agreements and registration processes.'
  objective: 'I was brought into the project due to several critical bugs that were affecting core functionalities of the app. After a meeting with the team to understand the specific issues, I conducted a deep technical analysis of both the frontend and backend codebases. I then proceeded to debug and run the system locally to identify the root cause of a pricing calculation error. Although I was not the original developer of the application, I successfully implemented a fix for the issue. In the following days, I also contributed by developing new features aimed at improving the internal staffâ€™s experience with the platform.'
