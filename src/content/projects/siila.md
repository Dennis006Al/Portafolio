  overview: >
    This project initially focused on upgrading a legacy Angular 7 codebase to Angular 13 to improve performance, modernize the stack, and unlock new framework features. During the migration, I encountered and resolved multiple issues related to deprecated libraries and outdated tooling, replacing them with modern, supported alternatives.

  objective: |
    The main objective of this project was to modernize and optimize a legacy Angular 7 application by upgrading it to Angular 13. This involved identifying and resolving numerous migration issues, including deprecated dependencies and breaking changes, while ensuring application stability.

    Once the technical foundation was modernized, I focused on redesigning and implementing new user-facing pages based on detailed Figma mockups. The redesign aimed to improve the overall user experience and align the platform with the company’s branding and business goals.

    I introduced dynamic and reusable components, such as property carousels, customized search filters, and multi-step forms to streamline user interaction. The project also required multilingual support (English, Spanish, and Portuguese), which I implemented using Angular’s i18n tools. In addition, I refactored and rebuilt key UI sections, including the footer, to enhance navigation and usability across devices.

  reflection: >
    Working on this migration project taught me how to navigate the complexity of modernizing a large-scale application. It sharpened my ability to resolve compatibility issues and replace outdated tools with better alternatives. I also gained valuable experience implementing internationalization (i18n) and collaborating with design specifications in Figma to deliver a polished, multilingual user interface.
