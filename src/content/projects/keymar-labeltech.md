  overview: |
    This project originated from the company's need to improve their existing website and provide a more effective way to showcase their products and services.

  objective: |
    The original website was outdated and poorly structured, which prompted the client to reach out for a complete redesign.

    I proposed using Astro for its excellent SEO performance and simplicity when building landing pages. After meeting with the person in charge, we collaborated on planning the site structure and defining the visual direction they were aiming for.

  techStack:
    - 'Astro'

  contributions:
    - 'Led the full redesign of the companyâ€™s marketing website'
    - 'Proposed and implemented Astro for its SEO capabilities and performance'
    - 'Worked closely with the client to define structure and design direction'
    - 'Delivered a fast and modern landing experience to improve brand presence'

  reflection: |
    This project gave me the opportunity to take ownership of a complete site redesign, from technology choice to structure and delivery.

    It reaffirmed the value of clear communication with clients when translating business needs into technical decisions.

    Working with Astro also strengthened my experience building fast, SEO-optimized static sites.
